                Cases of Covid-19 first emerged in late 2019, when a mysterious illness was reported in Wuhan, China. The cause of the disease was soon confirmed as a new kind of coronavirus, and the infection has since spread to many countries around the world and become a pandemic.
               </p>
           <p class="hide" id="hide1">
                On 11 February the World Health Organization announced that the official name would be covid-19, a shortened version of coronavirus disease 2019, refering to the specific virus that causes this disease as the covid-19 virus.
        
                Most commonly reported symptoms include tiredness, dry cough and fever. While in milder cases the infected person may just have slightly running nose and sore throat. Some carriers experience no noticable symptoms at all, but are still contagious and can spread the disease. In severe cases however, people with the virus can develop difficulty breathing, and may ultimately experience organ failure. Some cases are fatal.

            <br>
                The risk of death has been difficult to calculate, as it relies on accurate numbers of those who have symptoms but survive – and some countries, including the US, have been slow to increase capacity for testing. A small study of people who contracted covid-19 in Wuhan suggests that the risk of death increases with age, and is also higher for those who have diabetes, disease, blood clotting problems, or have shown signs of sepsis.

Children, on the other hand, seem to be less likely to get severely ill and die from the new coronavirus, possibly due to less developed immune responses. Pregnant people don’t seem to be at greater risk of experiencing severe covid-19 than other adults, and it doesn’t seem to pass on to fetuses, but  further, larger studies are needed to confirm this.

Young, healthy adults are still at risk of contracting  covid-19 and developing severe, life-threatening disease.

            <p>
                People may be sick with the virus for 1 to 14 days before developing symptoms. The most common symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are :
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cough</li>

                There is no specific medicine to prevent or treat coronavirus disease (COVID-19). People may need supportive care to help them breathe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Self-care

If you have mild symptoms, stay at home until you’ve recovered. You can relieve your symptoms if you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>rest and sleep</li>
                <li>keep warm</li>
                <li>drink plenty of liquids </li>
                <li>use a room humidifier or take a hot shower to help ease a sore throat and cough
</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Medical treatments

If you develop a fever, cough, and have difficulty breathing, promptly seek medical care. Call in advance and tell your health provider of any recent travel or recent contact with travelers.
